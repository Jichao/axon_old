Depends
-------------------
depends source tarball is ditributed in depends/archieve

Jinja2 
  http://www.lua.org/
  a template engine used for auto code generation  
  Install to system first.

Lua5.1
  http://www.lua.org/
  source code in depends/lua
  It's part of axon engine, there's some modification in Lua VM, or some
optimized code, so it has slightly difference from official distribution.
  Don't use official distribution instead.

JsonCpp
  http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net/
  We widely use json as schema file or config file format.

Python 2.6+ 
  We widely use python to write tools like codegen, testtool, etc.
  Install to system first.


Build Axon
--------------------

First, install the depends.

Axon can be compiled and used on Linux, *BSD
It support little endian CPU only. (x86).

We recommend little endian architectures. Some function(byte order related)
is not guaranteed to work on big endian machine.
compiler recommend: g++

It is as simple as:
  % make

the makefile object dependency is defined in Makefile.dep ,
code contributor can modified this file if added/deleted source file.
